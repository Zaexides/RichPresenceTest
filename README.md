# RichPresenceTester
A simple C# application for testing Discord Rich Presence.  

# Getting Started
First of all, go to the Discord Developer page and create an application, then enable rich presence on it and add whatever you want. In the tester, put the "Client ID" in the "App ID" field and give it a name you'll recognize it with, then press the "Add" button. It should now appear in the dropdown on the left.  

To add icons, enter the icon name and whether it's a small or large icon, then press add.  

To change the in-app name, simply paste in the same Client ID and give it a different name. The "Add" button should turn into a "Rename" button.
